# Modeling Car Insurance Claim Outcomes

This project builds a predictive model for On the Road car insurance to identify which customers are likely to make a claim during their policy period. Given the company's limited machine learning infrastructure, the goal is to find the **single most predictive feature** that delivers the highest model accuracy. The analysis uses logistic regression on a cleaned customer dataset to determine the optimal simple model for potential deployment.

This project was completed using DataCamp’s Datalab environment.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Load and explore customer data related to car insurance claims
- Handle missing values in key variables
- Train individual logistic regression models using **each feature separately**
- Evaluate model performance by **accuracy**, calculated using a **confusion matrix**
- Identify the **single best-performing feature** for predicting insurance claims

## 🔍 Key Findings

- ✅ **Best predictive feature**: `driving_experience`  
- 📊 **Highest model accuracy**: **77.71%**  
- 🧠 Among all individual features, **driving experience** was the strongest predictor of whether a customer would make a claim
- 🛠️ Missing values in `credit_score` (9.82%) and `annual_mileage` (9.57%) were imputed using the **median** value

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python**
- **pandas** for data loading and preprocessing
- **statsmodels** (`logit`) for logistic regression modeling
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Jupyter Notebook / DataLab** for analysis and visualization
